        <a href="home.html" class"nav_link">Home Page</a>
        <a href="games.html" class="nav_link">Games Page</a>

      </nav>
      <div class="main_area">
        <h2>This is the Games Page</h2>
        <article class="center column">
         This actually the games page where in a real website there would be a discussion of games or links to gaming news or something like that; however, this is only a fake website built for an exercise so it doesn't actually contain anything.
        </article>
        <article class="left sub column">
          This space could be good for containing a top 10 list of some genre of game:
          <ol>
            <li>Game 1</li>
            <li>Game 2</li>
            <li>Game 3</li>
            <li>Game 4</li>
            <li>Game 5</li>
            <li>Game 6</li>
            <li>Game 7</li>
            <li>Game 8</li>
            <li>Game 9</li>
            <li>Game 10</li>
          </ol>
        </article>
        <article class="right sub column">
          On the other hand, a space like this could also just be used to point out the critical elements of a well designed game:
          <ul>
            <li>This is important.</li>
            <li>So is this.</li>
            <li>Oh, and we can't forget about this.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </div>
    <footer>
      Down here would go various bits of page information like disclaimers, a link to a site map, and other stuff.
