        <h2>This is the Home Page</h2>
        <article class="center column">
         This is where most of the text for the web page will go. It should reach across the screen before it starts to wrap to the next line, and should go clear across the top of both of the lower columns.
        </article>
        <article class="left sub column">
          This is the left column for text under the main text area. <s>Hopefully this will wrap within the table.</s> It worked! Ignore that part with the line through it.
        </article>
        <article class="right sub column">
          Now that I know that <strong>that</strong> part is working properly, I can rest reasonably assured that <em>this</em> part with also work.

    <footer>
      Down here would go various bits of page information like disclaimers, a link to a site map, and other stuff.
